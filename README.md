# Protocol Integration

This repository contains metadata for integrating external protocols, including addresses and relevant integration URLs for various markets.

## Metadata Structure

The YAML file includes details for multiple objects (PT, YT, LP), each corresponding to different parts of the protocol with specific chain IDs, addresses, integration URLs, and descriptions.

### Fields

#### Protocols fields

 - name: The name of the protocol.
 - icon: The protocolâ€™s logo (circular logo in PNG). The string on this field should be the same as the name of the logo file uploaded. Size limit for logo is 20KB.
 - metadata: This section contains detailed information about the protocol's integration assets.

#### Asset fields
 - chainId: chainId of the integrated assets
 - address: Address of the integrated assets (PT token address for PT integrations, LP token address for LP integration, etc)
 - integrationUrl: Link to the page that integrated the asset
 - description: Description of the asset

### Example

```yaml
name: Protocol Name 2
